The USA Crime Dashboard is an interactive Shiny application that enables users to explore historical crime trends across U.S. cities and states. The dashboard provides dynamic filtering by year, geography, crime category, and measurement type to support comparisons of crime rates over time and across locations. Through coordinated visualizations and summary metrics, the app helps users identify geographic patterns, temporal trends, and relative crime risk.
