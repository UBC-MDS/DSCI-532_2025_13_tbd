### Persona and Usage Scenario

Alex and Alexandra, are a young couple from South Africa looking to start a family. They grew up as farmers, but due to the recent political climate, general unrest, and high crime rates, they want to leave for a safer life. They have decided on moving to the United States, following president Trump’s announcements that South African farmers may be eligible to apply for refugee status. However, they recognize that various parts of the U.S. are no safer than South Africa. As they plan for children, they want to settle in the safest neighborhood or area possible. To support this decision, they are looking for a quick and accessible way to visualize crime rates across cities and compare different types of crime across locations.

When Alex and Alexandra log onto the “Crime Statistics US app,” they will see a map of the United States of America with bubbles over cities present in the data frame, the size of which will represent the relative crime rates. With this map, Alex and Alexandra can clearly compare relative crime rates between cities. They are also able to filter for specific states, crime reports, years, and zoom into specific states. If they click on a city, they can even view the crime rate trends over time for each of the different crime statistics available. 

Based on their use of the map, Alex and Alexandra have decided that the most crime happens in major cities and want to move somewhere more rural where they can start a farm. They decide on rural Kansas as a safe, remote area away from the city where they can live in peace and raise their children.
